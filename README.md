world model can be trained quickly in an unsupervised manner to learn a compressed spatial and temporal representation of the environment


Humans develop a mental model of the world based on what they are able to perceive with their limited senses. The decisions and actions we make are based on this internal model. Jay Wright Forrester, the father of system dynamics, described a mental model as:

“The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system.” [3]

To handle the vast amount of information that flows through our daily lives, our brain learns an abstract representation of both spatial and temporal aspects of this information. We are able to observe a scene and remember an abstract description thereof [4, 5]. Evidence also suggests that what we perceive at any given moment is governed by our brain’s prediction of the future based on our internal model [6, 7].
